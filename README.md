Spring Exercise

The following exercise can be developed:
Either with spring-boot (Bonus, as it will be much shorter) or regular spring web project. 
Either with JDK 1.8 (Bonus) or lower versions
Either with Spring-Data-JPA(Bonus)  or without
Either with Maven or Gradle(Bonus) 
You can use your favorite IDE, and DB (you will also use in-memory DB for testing).


Exercise 1
In this Exercise you need to create a “Trading Application” using Spring. 

This application should have two entities: Trader and Transaction. Each Transaction is associated to the trader who executed it. 
The properties for the trader are (id:Integer, name:String, city:String). 
The properties for the Transaction are (id:Integer, trader:Trader, year:int, int:value).
Your mission is to create two beans that use the entities above (obviously you should create the entities as well): 
TransactionMemoryRepository bean. This bean should hold two in-memory lists for the Traders and Transactions. You should initialize these list in Spring initialized method of the bean
You should create five methods for this bean: 
Find all traders
Add a trader
Find all transactions for year
Find unique cities of traders who committed transactions ordered alphabetically
Find all traders who committed transaction for a given city

Bonus : Externalize some properties of your beans to external properties file.
Bonus Plus Plus : Write the code with Java8 Functional Programming style.


You should write a Spring test for this bean – Inject the bean to the test class and check all methods work.



Exercise 2
Create a RESTful Spring application that exposes the business method above, but this time you should use a RDBMS. You should do it by creating a Spring REST Controller bean (and optional a service bean).
The REST api should be as follow:
GET : http://localhost:8080/traders
POST : http://localhost:8080/traders
GET : http://localhost:8080/transactions?year=YEAR
GET : http://localhost:8080/transactions/cities
GET : http://localhost:8080/transactions/traders?city=CITY

All DB properties (i.e. user, password, drive, DB-URL) should be externalized to properties file.
Bonus : Use some connection pool (C3P0 or BoneCP)
The Service above should delegate to a separate to Repository beans (TraderRepository and Transactionrepository) to apply the DB operations.
Create TradeServiceTests class that test all the services above.
Secure the application by providing basic authentication for the application. You should enable at least one user to check this.
Bonus: Check the REST api with RestTemplate
